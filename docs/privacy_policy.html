        <h1>TerraMap Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: April 24, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>Welcome to TerraMap, a geospatial analysis tool developed by Ray C. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use TerraMap. By using TerraMap, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: If you use the "Current Location" feature, TerraMap may collect your approximate location (e.g., city-level data) via a third-party service (ipapi.co) to center the map on your position. This data is only used to provide the requested functionality and is not stored.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Provided Data</strong>: When you enter an OpenCage API key and email in the app’s configuration, this information is stored locally in a `config.ini` file on your device. It is used solely to authenticate API requests to OpenCage for geocoding and reverse geocoding.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: TerraMap sends requests to third-party APIs (OpenCage Geocoding API, Open-Elevation API) when you perform searches, add markers, or calculate elevations. These requests may include coordinates, search queries, or other data necessary for the app’s functionality. We do not store this data.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve TerraMap’s functionality, such as centering the map on your location, performing geocoding searches, and calculating surface areas or elevation profiles.</li>
            <li>Authenticate API requests to third-party services (OpenCage, Open-Elevation) using your provided API key and email.</li>
            <li>Ensure the app operates securely and efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party APIs</strong>: When you use TerraMap, data such as coordinates or search queries is sent to OpenCage Geocoding API and Open-Elevation API to provide the requested features. These services have their own privacy policies, which you can review at:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://opencagedata.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenCage Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://open-elevation.com/privacy" target="_blank">Open-Elevation Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://ipapi.co/privacy/" target="_blank">ipapi.co Privacy Policy</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the safety, rights, or property of TerraMap or its users.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            - Your OpenCage API key and email are stored locally in a `config.ini` file on your device and are not transmitted to us.
            - Location and usage data are processed temporarily during app operation and not stored by TerraMap.
            - We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but no system is completely secure. Please ensure your device is protected against unauthorized access.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
            - You can opt not to provide an OpenCage API key, though this will disable search and current location features.
            - You can delete the `config.ini` file to remove your API key and email from your device.
            - The "Current Location" feature is optional and can be avoided if you prefer not to share location data.
        </p>
        
        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>TerraMap is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have such information, please contact us immediately.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Please check this policy regularly for updates.</p>
